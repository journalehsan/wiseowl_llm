# 🦉 WiseOwl Adaptive AI Architecture

## Alpha Design & Expansion Specification

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document formalizes the **WiseOwl Adaptive AI system** as it exists in **alpha**, and extends it with planned features and architectural safeguards.

It is intended to:

* Stabilize the current mental model
* Prevent architectural drift
* Enable incremental development without rewriting core logic
* Serve as a shared reference for future contributors

WiseOwl AI is **not a chatbot**. It is a **multi-agent, memory-aware, experience-driven orchestration system** designed to assist humans without replacing judgment.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy

### 2.1 Intelligence as Instrument, Not Authority

WiseOwl AI:

* Suggests, never decrees
* Explains uncertainty
* Leaves an audit trail
* Defers when confidence is low

The system is optimized for **usefulness under uncertainty**, not absolute correctness.

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture

WiseOwl AI consists of **three cooperating models** sharing a common interface but trained and calibrated differently.

### 3.1 Model Roles

#### 3.1.1 Router Model (Policy Brain)

Responsible for:

* Task routing
* Model selection (local vs external)
* Cost, privacy, and latency decisions
* Confidence gating
* Escalation to human or second model

Temperament:

* Conservative
* Deterministic
* Preference-driven

---

#### 3.1.2 Worker Model (Generator)

Responsible for:

* Drafting text
* Classifying emails and events
* Extracting entities and commitments
* Proposing tasks, meetings, and replies

Temperament:

* Fast
* Creative
* Allowed to be wrong

---

#### 3.1.3 Reviewer Model (Skeptic)

Responsible for:

* Logical consistency checks
* Hallucination detection
* Overconfidence detection
* Policy and safety checks
* Confidence score adjustment

Temperament:

* Slow
* Risk-averse
* Boring by design

---

## 4. Memory System (Three-Tier Model)

WiseOwl AI maintains **three explicit memory tiers**, inspired by human cognition and version-control systems.

### 4.1 Memory Tiers

#### 4.1.1 Short-Term Memory (STM)

* Recent interactions
* Active tasks
* Current conversation context
* Ephemeral state

Characteristics:

* High volatility
* No long-term guarantees

---

#### 4.1.2 Mid-Term Memory (MTM)

* Repeated preferences
* Active projects
* Common workflows
* Frequently referenced documents

Characteristics:

* Summarized
* Periodically re-scored

---

#### 4.1.3 Long-Term Memory (LTM)

* Stable user preferences
* Proven patterns
* Durable skills and styles
* High-value domain knowledge

Characteristics:

* Compact representations
* Strict promotion criteria

---

### 4.2 Memory Promotion & Demotion

Each memory item has a score:

```
importance = frequency × outcome × recency × role_weight − noise_penalty
```

Rules:

* STM → MTM if importance > T1
* MTM → LTM if importance > T2 for N sleep cycles
* Demotion occurs if score drops below D thresholds

Deletion:

* Immediate removal from retrieval
* Gradual decay from summaries and adapters

---

## 5. Sleep Cycle (Maintenance & Learning)

WiseOwl AI supports a **user-configurable sleep window**.

### 5.1 Sleep Responsibilities

During sleep, the system performs:

* Memory deduplication
* Importance re-scoring
* Promotion/demotion
* Summary distillation
* Vector index rebuilds
* Hallucination rate evaluation
* Preparation of anonymized learning deltas

Sleep is:

* Interruptible
* Auditable
* Never user-facing

---

## 6. Local vs Cloud Learning (Queen Model)

### 6.1 Local User AI

Each user has a **personal AI instance**:

* Learns from that user only
* May run offline
* Uses retrieval-first learning
* Optionally uses lightweight adapters

---

### 6.2 Cloud "Queen" Model

The cloud model:

* Never stores raw private data
* Receives anonymized patterns (opt-in)
* Trains improved routing heuristics
* Distributes general improvements

Acts as:

* Teacher
* Aggregator
* Policy updater

Not a central brain.

---

## 7. Learning Channels

### 7.1 Channel A – Retrieval Learning (Primary)

* Documents
* Emails
* Tasks
* Meetings
* User preferences

Fast, reversible, safe.

---

### 7.2 Channel B – Skill Adaptation (Optional)

* Style adapters
* Routing preferences
* Reviewer sensitivity tuning

Strictly versioned and reversible.

---

## 8. Confidence & Verification System

### 8.1 Confidence Scoring

Every AI output carries:

* Confidence score
* Source grounding
* Model identity

---

### 8.2 Confidence Gates

| Score     | Behavior            |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| ≥ 0.85    | Suggest prominently |
| 0.60–0.84 | Optional suggestion |
| < 0.60    | Ask user / escalate |

---

## 9. Cross-Model Consultation

When:

* Confidence is low
* Stakes are high

The Router may:

* Query a second, diverse model
* Compare outputs
* Require reviewer agreement

This acts as a **circuit breaker**, not a default path.

---

## 10. Internal Reasoning & Auditability

Worker models may use unrestricted internal reasoning.

However:

* All external outputs must be structured
* Reviewer enforces explanation schemas
* No action without rationale

---

## 11. Versioning & Rolling Release

Versioned artifacts:

* Router policies
* Reviewer rubrics
* Memory schema
* Evaluation suites

Rolling release rules:

* Shadow evaluation before rollout
* Automatic rollback on regression

---

## 12. Guiding Constraints

* No irreversible action without trace
* No learning without user benefit
* No optimization for confidence alone
* No single model holds authority

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

---

## 13. Technical Stack

This implementation is primarily based on **Rust** for performance and safety, with optional **Python** components when necessary for specific ML libraries or integrations that cannot be implemented in Rust.

---

## 14. Summary

WiseOwl AI is designed as:

> A careful organization of imperfect intelligences,
> not a single perfect mind.

Its power comes from:

* Structure
* Memory discipline
* Confidence management
* Human alignment

This document defines the stable foundation upon which future features can be safely added.

* AI helps without interrupting
* Mistakes are visible and reversible
* System improves with use
* One developer can maintain it

---

## Closing Principle

> WiseOwl v1 does not need to be smarter than humans.
> It needs to be **more careful than confident humans under pressure**.

That is enough to ship.

---

# 🎯 v1 Priority Guidelines (Preventing Scope Creep)

## The Classic Trap: Product Becomes Galaxy Before Lamp 🌌🪔

WiseOwl must avoid becoming a "galaxy before lamp" - a project so complex it never becomes useful. These guidelines keep it **buildable by one dev, useful early, and safe to evolve**.

---

## The "v1 Spine" (Keep This Sacred)

These 6 items form the core value proposition:

1. **Ingest** (IMAP/EWS email connectivity)
2. **Classify + Priority** (Worker model email processing)
3. **AI Insights + Suggestions** (UI integration)
4. **Task/Reminder Creation** (User-confirmed actions)
5. **Daily Digest** (Summarized insights)
6. **Reviewer Gate + Audit Trail** (Safety and trust)

**If you ship just this spine, users will already feel: "this is different."**

---

## The "v1 Muscles" (Add Only After Spine Works)

These extend the spine without compromising timeline:

* Behavior learning (open/reply/dismiss signals)
* Better views (Actionable / Waiting items)
* Meeting suggestions
* Second-model consultation (high-stakes, low-confidence only)

---

## The "v2 Dreams" (Park Them Safely)

These are powerful but belong to future releases:

* Per-user adapters / training
* Queen model learning loops  
* Deep personalization beyond retrieval
* Advanced multi-model orchestration

---

## 🔴 One Rule That Will Save Months

**If a feature can't be explained as:**

> "It makes the user trust WiseOwl more *today*"

**it's probably a v2 feature.**

---

## 🛤️ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Spine First (Weeks 1-4)
Focus on getting emails in, classified, and showing basic AI insights.

### Phase 2: Muscles Next (Weeks 5-8)  
Add the learning loops and better UI once trust is established.

### Phase 3: Dreams Later (Future)
Tackle advanced personalization when users are asking for it.

---

## 🧭 Decision Framework

When evaluating any new feature, ask:

1. Does this make WiseOwl **more trustworthy** today?
2. Can this be **implemented with retrieval only** initially?
3. Is this **user-confirmable** (no irreversible AI actions)?
4. Does this **serve the spine** or distract from it?

---

## 🏁 Success Definition

**v1 is successful when:**

* Users can point to specific AI insights that saved them time
* The audit trail makes every AI decision explainable
* The system improves with use (even simple usage signals)
* One developer can understand and maintain the entire codebase

---

**You're not shrinking the vision. You're staging it so it can actually land.** 🦉⚙️
